# The Sandwich Man

A Git and Swift exercise for Wabisabi's iOS devs

## Instructions

1. Create a brand new Playground in Xcode called "SandwichMan". Copy the contents of SandwichManTemplate.swift into your new Playground and save.

2. Create a new repo for your Playground in Github. Commit and push your new playground to the repo you just created (initial commit).

3. Complete each exercise in the playground to the best of your ability. Feel free to add comments, create helper functions and do whatever else you need to make your code clear and easy to follow.

4. Commit your answers and push them to your repo. Write your commit(s) as if this playground were a group project (i.e. others will be reading, pulling and using your changes for future development)
